Two-dimensional array with calloc

    Define a pointer to pointer to double:
        double **b;

    Allocate a one-dimensional array of pointers to double
        b = (double **) calloc(100, sizeof(double*));

    For each of the pointer to double, allocate an array of double, let the pointer pointing to it.
        for(i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {

        b[i] = (double *) calloc(30, sizeof(double));
        }

    After this, you can use b as if it was declared as
        double b[100][30];

        b[79][21] = 2.1;
