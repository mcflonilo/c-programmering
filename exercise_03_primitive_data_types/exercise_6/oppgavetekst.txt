Exercise 6:

Fibonacci series:
a[n] = a[n-1] + a[n-2]
a[0] = 0
a[1] = 1

write a program that takes in an integer and gives out the a[integer].

Hint : Recursion
Calculate run time of the core calculation - by using this function:
-------------------------
2

unsigned long GetTime() {
  struct timeval tv;
  gettimeofday(&tv,NULL);
  return tv.tv_sec*(unsigned long)1000000+tv.tv_usec;
}

In the main code :
        unsigned long timeStart, timeEnd;
        timeStart = GetTime();
        //Do some processing here;
        timeEnd = GetTime();
        printf("The elapsed time is %lu ms", (timeEnd - timeStart)/1000);
-------------------------
Can you make it more effective?
