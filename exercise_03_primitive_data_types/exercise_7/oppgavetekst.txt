Exercise 7:

Quadratic solution:

For an equation of the sort :

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

There are two floating-point solutions s1,s2. The expressions for those solutions are as
written on the white board

Write a program that takes three inputs and gives out the solutions.
Example :
$./solver 1 -2 1
Solution 1 is x = 1
Solution 2 is x = 2

Try the same for these inputs:
$./solver 1 -2 1
$./solver 1 2 1
$./solver 1 5 2
$./solver 0 2 5
$./solver 1 1 1

Hint:
Use math.h and sqrt for square root
atof() - can be used to convert string to float - read more at man atof
What is wrong with the later cases and how do you think we can solve it?
