Exercise 3 :

Write a program that takes a number as an argument and prints if it is odd or even?
Example :$./program 5
         Number 5 is read and it is odd.
         $./program all
         Please provide a non-zero integer as argument!
         $./program 0
         Please provide a non-zero integer as argument!
         $./program 6bva
         Number 6 is read and it is even.

Hint : Use argc, argv of the main
       atoi() - can be used to convert string to int - read more at man atoi
